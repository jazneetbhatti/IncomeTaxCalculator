This is a Web App for calculating Total Income and Income Tax.

Requirements:
===========
For both Linux and Windows:
--------------------------
PHP
MySQL
Apache web server( although any other should work fine too )
phpMyAdmin(optional)

For Windows only:
----------------
XAMPP : Windows users could instead just install xampp, as it installs all the above mentioned requirements.

Webpages:
=========
Copy all files in the webpages directory to the document root of your apache( or the web server you're using ) installation : usually '/var/www/html' for Fedora or Red Hat, '/srv/www/htdocs' for openSUSE, '/var/www' for Ubuntu, 'C://Program Files/xampp/htdocs' for Windows.

Open db-connect.php and change the variables accordingly. Set $user as your Mysql database user, $password as the password of the Mysql database user, $database as the name of the database and $host as the name of the mysql host( leave unchanged if the database is on the same machine ).

Database:
=========
Now create the tables in database with the database.sql file in the sql directory. If you want the name of the database to be incomeTaxDB, run this command to create the database :
$ mysql -u root -p -e 'create database incomeTaxDB'

and run this command to import the database( assuming the database file is in the current directory. If not, specify the full path of database.sql )
$ mysql -u root -p incomeTaxDB < database.sql

If phpMyAdmin is installed, the database.sql database can directly be imported by logging in to 'localhost/phpmyadmin' and importing the database.
